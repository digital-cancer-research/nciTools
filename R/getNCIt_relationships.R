#' Get NCIt Relationships from NCI Thesaurus API
#'
#' This function queries the NCI Thesaurus to retrieve relationships based on a given code and inclusion criteria.
#' It fetches information from the National Cancer Institute's EVS API for a given concept and returns the specified relationships.
#'
#' @param code A character string representing the NCIt code (concept ID) for which to retrieve relationships.
#' @param include_what A character string indicating the type of relationships to include. Valid options are:
#'   `roles`, `inverseRoles`, `associations`, or `inverseAssociations`.
#'   This determines which relationship information will be returned for the specified code.
#'
#' @return A data frame containing the specified relationships for the NCIt code. If no relationships are found, it returns `NULL`.
#'
#' @details
#' This function constructs a request to the NCI EVS API endpoint to search for the specified NCIt code and includes the relationships
#' based on the `include_what` parameter. The result is parsed into a tibble (data frame), with each relationship type presented
#' in separate columns.
#'
#' The following values are valid for `include_what`:
#'
#' - `roles`: Returns roles associated with the concept.
#' - `inverseRoles`: Returns inverse roles related to the concept.
#' - `associations`: Returns associations linked to the concept.
#' - `inverseAssociations`: Returns inverse associations for the concept.
