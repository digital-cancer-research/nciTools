\title{Create a Specific Dictionary from NCI Thesaurus Data}
\usage{
createDictionary(source_data, semantic_types)
}
\arguments{
\item{source_data}{A dataset derived from the NCI Thesaurus, expected to contain detailed term
information including unique codes, synonyms, and semantic types. This data serves as the input
for generating the dictionary.}

\item{semantic_types}{A character vector specifying the semantic types of interest. These types
define the scope of the dictionary, determining which terms from the source data are included based
on their semantic classification.}
}
\value{
Returns a dictionary object structured for annotation purposes. The dictionary is
specifically designed to map unique codes (representing specific terms) to a list of synonyms,
allowing for comprehensive term identification. This is particularly useful for annotating texts
with terms that may appear in various synonymous forms.
}
\description{
This function constructs a dictionary for a specific set of semantic types from the NCI Thesaurus data.
It processes the source data to filter and organize terms based on the specified semantic types,
facilitating the creation of targeted dictionaries for use in annotation tasks. The output dictionary
is structured to associate unique codes with their corresponding synonyms, enhancing the annotation
process by allowing for the identification of terms through various synonymous expressions.
